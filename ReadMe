To run the Map-Coloring problem CSP:
1) right click on the map_coloring_class.py
2) click 'run'
- to get this class to run, you must instantiate all the variables with territory names and domains, and give that information
to a CSP object that holds all the variables, domains of the variables, and the constraints.
- You also need to instantiate an algorithms object that holds the backtracking algorithm and heuristics
- Once you have csp object to run in the backtracking algorithm, you're all set.

To run the Circuit-Board problem CSP:
1) right click on the circuit_board_class.py
2) click 'run'
- to get this class to run you need to instantiate components that take a length, width, and a character that they will be
drawn as. 'a' for example.
- you also need to instantiate the board that will be holding these components, which also takes a length and a width, as well
as a character that you want the background of the board to be. In ASCII it is a '.'
-this CSP implementation only requires a list of components and the board. Constraints are based on overlapping values, not
predetermined geographical relationships, so they do not need to be given.
